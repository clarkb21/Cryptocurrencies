# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
- The purpose of this project is to showcase skills using Unsupervised machine learning models to create patterns for analysis regarding cryptocurrencies. 
- Using the K-Means Algorithm, data was clustered into groups to make a better analysis about how to predict data. 

## Project Overview
- Preprocessing is an important step when using machine learning models, because the algorithms only understand numerical, formatted data. 
- Another important step in the preprocessing stage is to scale the model so one type of data does not receive any additional weight towards the algorithms' pattern prediction techniques. 
- Once the data is cleaned, Principal Component Analysis was executed to reduce the amount of variables down to the three most important factors. 


### Challenge Overview
- Data was preprocessed and dimensionality reduction was performed to prepare to use the K-Means Unsupervised Machine Learning Model. 
- K-Mean clustering was performed to group the cryptocurrencies to make better analysis. 
- The results were then visualized using hv plot, creating graphs in 3D and 2D scatter plots to showcase the clusters in a user friendly way.
